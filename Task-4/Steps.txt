# Steps Executed

1. Created a Sample text file with some content
2. git add <filename> - to stage the changes

3. git commit -m "Initial commit with sample.txt" - To commit the changes
[main 4885496] Initial Commit with sample.txt
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 Task-4/sample.txt

4. git checkout -b conflicts - Created a new branch named conflicts
Switched to a new branch 'conflicts'

5. Modified the sample.txt file by adding new line of content.

6. git commit -am "Updated sample.txt" - a (auto stage Modified files) and m (commit message). Quick solution to stage and commit in single command.
[conflicts a6b01c1] Updated sample.txt
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)

7. Again switch back to main branch
Switched to branch 'main'
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.

8.  Again Created a new branch (conflict2) and switched to that branch.
Switched to a new branch 'conflict2'

9. git commit -am "Updated sample.txt" - Modified the file and commited it.
[conflict2 e6ef574] Updated sample.txt
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)

10. Again switch back to main branch
Switched to branch 'main'
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

11. git merge conflicts - Merging the main and conflicts branch.
Updating 4885496..a6b01c1
Fast-forward
 Task-4/sample.txt | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)

12. git merge conflict2 - Merging the conflict2 branch
Auto-merging Task-4/sample.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in Task-4/sample.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

13. git status - To see the status and issues
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 2 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

You have unmerged paths.
  (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
  (use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)
        both modified:   sample.txt

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        Steps.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

14. git diff - to see the  difference between branches

diff --cc Task-4/sample.txt
index 2f65f69,93d0bdc..0000000
--- a/Task-4/sample.txt
+++ b/Task-4/sample.txt
@@@ -1,2 -1,2 +1,6 @@@
